## Current Behavior

icc browser uses WKWebView networking. Proxy behavior follows macOS/system networking and app process environment.

## What Is Not Exposed via CLI

There is currently no first-class `icc browser proxy ...` command for per-surface proxy routing.

Why: WKWebView does not provide CDP-style per-context proxy controls equivalent to Chrome automation stacks.

## Workarounds

1. Configure system/network-level proxy for the environment where icc runs.
2. Route traffic through an upstream gateway you control.
3. Validate behavior with explicit IP checks.

## Verification

```bash
icc browser open https://httpbin.org/ip --json
icc browser surface:7 get text body
```

Compare returned IP against expected proxy egress.
